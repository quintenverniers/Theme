#### Disclaimer

I made this theme for personal usage. I forked the Naruto Dark theme by Thomaz and used it as a base.
He should also receive credits for his efforts on the original theme. Checkout his Naruto Dark theme as well.

Since I made this for personal use, I might make changes in the future as I use the theme more.
